# alien 👽

An audio visual toolkit for pure data (GEM) that is out of this world. ( WORK IN PROGRESS )

# Rationale

I'm against proprietory software like max/msp or touch designer as an audio visual artist I believe in free and open source. You should not have to pay to be an artist or be beholden to companies. Your work will likely be obvious, self similar and samey. Given enough examples of output you can infer the algorithmic process that derived it. The way to make original audio visual output is to create your own algorithmic processes... this framework is just one example of how to do this pure data and GEM.

# How is this different from other systems?

In most live coding system you have to worry about variables, state, functions and other complexity. In alien you only worry about patterns, mapping and making your audio visuals. The pattern DSL is incredibly simple and pure data and GEM is easy to install and get up and running compared to other code based systems.

It is possible to evolve patterns and perform without live coding, or live code or mix and match. Alien gives you the power and freedom of pure data for making audio, GLSL and GEM for visuals running in the same space (low latency). This allows you to create arbitrary mappings between audio things and visual things.

Most live coding systems care about audio or visuals... not both at the same time. Alien is designed to make audio visual performances and gives you the tools to accomplish this and the freedom to extend (no lock in to a paticular approach). You are free to pillage any useful ideas and to come up with your own framework or approach.

# how it works.

* Install this by adding it to your path
* Make sure dependencies are installed
* Copy the template project and rename it - add your own sounds - shaders - videos ( NOT READY YET )
* ...
